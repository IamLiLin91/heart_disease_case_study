## Background
- understanding what are the main contributing factors toward heart disease. 

- This is a patient-level dataset that measures key demographic and health outcomes for a given patient. 

- This dataset has been flagged whether or not that patient was ultimately diagnosed with heart disease in the target column.
## Objective
Utilize Machine Learning to build a predictive model to identify the main contributing factors towards heart disease.
### Attribute Information:
- age: age in years

- sex: (1 = male; 0 = female)

- cp: chest pain type

- trestbps: resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)

- chol:	serum cholestoral in mg/dl

- fbs: (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)

- restecg: resting electrocardiographic results

- thalach: maximum heart rate achieved

- exang: exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)

- oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest

- slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment

- ca: number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy

- thal:	3 = normal; 2 = fixed defect; 1 = reversable defect

- target: Flag if the patient has heart disease (1) or not (0)
